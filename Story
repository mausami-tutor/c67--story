*******Story of woodcutter******

Once upon a time there was a poor woodcutter, who used to go to the jungle everyday and bring back wood to sell.

One day he could not find enough wood , so he went deeper into the jungle.
He came across a very old well.
Next to the well there was a dry tree. He started cutting it and his axe fell into the well.
Immediately a goddess came out of the well holding an axe made of gold.
She asked him "Is this your axe?"
He replied "No My lady!"

The goddess then went back inside the well and came back with a silver axe.
She asked againa "Is this your axe?"
He replied "No. This isn't."

She dipped in again and came back with his iron axe.
He was happy to see his original axe.

The godded was also happy with his honesty and gifted him both the axes, the gold and silver.
