*******Story of woodcutter******

Once upon a time there was a bad woodcutter, who used to go to the jungle everyday and bring back wood to sell.

One day he could not find enough wood , so he went deeper into the jungle.
He came across a very old well.
Next to the well there was a dry tree. He started cutting it and his axe fell into the well.
Immediately a goddess came out of the well holding an axe made of gold.
She asked him "Is this your axe?"
He was greedy. He replied "yes! this is my axe!"

The goodded went inside the well and he waited and waited, but she never came back.
So he didn't get the gold and silver axes but lost his iron one too.
